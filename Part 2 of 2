Functional Manual Testing: Gherkin Manual Test Cases

Test Case 1: Verify the schedule returns a list of episodes with valid id and type

Feature: Schedule API Data Integrity

  Scenario: Each schedule item has a non-empty ID and type is always "episode"
    Given the BBC Schedule API endpoint is available
    When I request the schedule for "bbc_one_london" on "2024-05-06"
    Then each item in the "schedule" array should have a non-empty "id" field
    And the "type" field of each item should be equal to "episode"

Schedule Item ID and Type Validation

| Test Case ID           | TC_API_001
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Title                  | Verify each schedule item has a non-empty ID and type is "episode"
| Preconditions          | BBC Schedule API is accessible
| Test Data              | Channel: `bbc_one_london`, Date: `2024-05-06`
| Steps                  | 1. Send a GET request to `/schedules/bbc_one_london/2024-05-06`
|                        | 2. Parse the JSON response
|                        | 3. Iterate through each item in the `schedule` array
| Expected Results       | - Each item has a non-empty `id` field
|                        | - Each item has a `type` field equal to `episode`
| Pass/Fail Criteria     | Test passes if all items meet both conditions



Test Case 2: Verify only one episode is marked as "live" in the schedule

Feature: Live Episode Verification

  Scenario: Only one episode is marked as live in the schedule
    Given the BBC Schedule API returns a schedule for "bbc_one_london" on "2024-05-06"
    When I inspect all items in the "schedule" array
    Then only one item should have the field "live" set to true

Live Episode Uniqueness

| Test Case ID           | TC_API_002
| ---------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Title                  | Verify only one episode is marked as "live"
| Preconditions          | Schedule API returns valid data
| Test Data              | Channel: `bbc_one_london`, Date: `2024-05-06`
| Steps                  | 1. Send a GET request to the schedule API
|                        | 2. Count the number of items where `"live": true`
| Expected Results       | Only one item in the response has `"live": true`
| Pass/Fail Criteria     | Test passes if exactly one episode is marked as live



Test Case 3: Validate the transmission times for episodes

Feature: Transmission Time Validity

  Scenario: Transmission start time should be before end time for all episodes
    Given the schedule for "bbc_one_london" on "2024-05-06" is retrieved from the API
    When I look at the "transmission" field for each item
    Then the "start" time should be earlier than the "end" time for each episode

Transmission Time Validity

| Test Case ID           | TC_API_003
| ---------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Title                  | Verify that start time is before end time for transmissions
| Preconditions          | Valid episode data returned from API
| Test Data              | Channel: `bbc_one_london`, Date: `2024-05-06`
| Steps                  | 1. Request schedule data from the API
|                        | 2. For each episode, compare the `transmission.start` and `transmission.end` timestamps
| Expected Results       | Each episode has a `start` time that is earlier than the corresponding `end` time
| Pass/Fail Criteria     | Test passes if all episodes meet this condition
